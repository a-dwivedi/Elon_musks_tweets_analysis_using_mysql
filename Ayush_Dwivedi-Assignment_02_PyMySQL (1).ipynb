Similarly for the MySQL I had to use just one table and then a pretty much straight forward query to fetch the result. So I will say both of them were equal in difficulty for me.Now Structurally both the databases were easier in this case because the collection and the Table were quite sufficient to fetch the appropriate results and there was no dependeny on any other collection for this."

    "For the Task 2 where we had to find the Unique User ID's in the database. For that task I feel that SQL database was much easier and the reason for that is - SQL Database a table of Users where all the users are listed and hence if I have to make a search for unique users it is quite feasible as all the results are obtained from just one table. However this is not the case with the Mongo DB as here there is no central collection from where I can directly find all the users and different collections have different number of users and hence it is challenging to use the MongoDB collection to do this task. In mongo I collected the distinct user names from the different collections and the created a set with all the unique users obtained from the various collections. Such tasks are way more efficient with SQL databases."

    "So for handling the hastags what we can do is that we can create a seperate table for the Hashtags where each hash tag will be given a unique ID and that ways we will have a table with the unique hashtags.And now instead of creating any modifications to the exisitng tables what we can do is create a new table which will have have the hashtag_id and the status_id.  This way we can create a realtionship between the tags and the tweets by using the hastag_id and status_id as the Foriegn keys. This will help us manage things extremly efficiently as any time a new tweet is added we can just search if the hastag is already present- if it is present we can simply add the status_id to that hashtag_id and if not then we can simply add a new hastag with its hashtag_id and then link that particular tweet with it. So by using this approach we will not manipulate the existing table and our job of handling hashtags will get done.\n"

    "If the twitter decides the ability to customize the tweets characterstics like adding fonts,colors,size etc then we can implement ways to store this information in the database using both Mongo DB and SQL.\n",
    "For storing the tweets attribute information we can create a new table with fields like id, color,size,font family type etc. where each field can be of its respective type for example the id can be integer. color can be var char,size can be int, font family type can be var char and so on. The id field can act both as a primary key and the Foreign key and can thus link each tweet accuractely with its users. So\n",
    "with SQl this can be implemented in this way. For implementing the same thing in the Mongo DB what we can do is very straightforward like we have done in twitter_lists collection where we have attributes like profile_text_color, profile_link_color etc. so similar to this approach we can create extra attributes like text_color,text_font, text_family along with the text attribute and store these values there. So I feel that implementing this with the MongoDB will be easier than with the MySQL because of the followign reasons-\n",
    "1. Horizontal Scalibility - Mongo DB has this unique thing where we can scale it horizontally that is new things can be added but SQL database has vertical scalability and hence this type of situation is a problem for SQL database.\n",
